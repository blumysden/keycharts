B           Aadd9
Little baby on your knees
G#m                  F#m     E
'Cause the world has got you down

[VERSE 1]
F#7M/F
      Name-tagged tourists, sick at the sight of them
Bbm/F
      Tight-walking the sidewalk in spite of them
G#m             D#m                     C#
      As my headache moves from east to west
F#7M
      Mother, won't you open your arms and
Bbm
      Forgive me of all these bad thoughts?
G#m                      D#m          C#
      I'm blinded to the faces in the fog

[PRE-CHORUS]
Aadd9            C#m                         Aadd9
     But all the good in me is because of you

     It's true

[VERSE 2]
F#7M
      King-sized country wearing your worries out
Bbm7/F
      Headless heroes heaped by the pylons
G#m                 D#m             C#
      As a careless sun sets on the West
F#7M
      Sure as mother licking her finger
Bbm7
      To wipe the blush and smudge from my cheek
G#m                          D#m                 C#
      And wonder what will become of your little one

[PRE-CHORUS]
Aadd9            C#m
     But all the good in me is because of you
Aadd9
     It's true
